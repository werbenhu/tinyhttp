[https://github.com/werbenhu/tinyhttp](https://github.com/werbenhu/tinyhttp)


### Use the port

The default port is 8080. 

If you want to change the port.

For example, you want to use port 9000.

You can use the command `tinyhttp.exe -p 9000` to start the server.



### Add Static file

Put static files in the same directory as tinyhttp.exe

For example, you can put `test.txt` in the same directory as tinyhttp.exe

Now you can access `test.txt` via http://localhost:8080/test.txt
